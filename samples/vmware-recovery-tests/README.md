# Cohesity VMware backup restore test validation example

This is an example powershell for simple random recovery test for each VMware Protection Job.

Script will automatically select random virtual machines from each job for recovery. By default number is 2 per job, but this can altered to any other value. Script will clone VMs for recovery testing, and after succesful cloning it will validate VM status with VMware Tools running status.

## Credential files

This script uses encrypted credentials for authentication. You can create credentials with simple two commands:

```PowerShell
Get-Credential | Export-Clixml vmware_credentials.xml
Get-Credential | Export-Clixml cohesity_credentials.xml
```

Note: Secure XML files can only be decrypted by the user account that created them.
